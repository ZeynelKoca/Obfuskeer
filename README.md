# Obfuskeer
A Unity obfuscator tool made with Mono.Cecil

Note that Unity doesn't promote obfuscating for a reason. A lot of features can (and probably will) result in runtime errors, unless one keeps obfuscation to a minimum and manually removes fields/methods etc from being obfuscated.

This tool was initially created for a personal Unity game of mine.
